Issues I found in the movies.csv
- For some of the movies, the year column format are inconsistent. For example, some of the movies have parenthesis but 
some don’t. Some movies also doesn’t have the start date or end date. This will make it harder for the user to process 
because they’re unable to use matching the start date or end date when working on the dataset. 
- So I’m tactically this issue by splitting the “Year” field into 2 fields: “Start” and “End”. I will use sed to accomplish 
this task.
